# Changelog

Floorplan Plus is a fork of [Spatial Context](https://github.com/Greminn/ha-spatial-context). Entries from 1.0.0 down are the original project's.

## Unreleased

### Changed
- Renamed to Floorplan Plus (domain `floorplan_plus`), so it can be installed next to Spatial Context without clashing. The panel, actions (`floorplan_plus.get_map`), storage and debug log use the new name.
- Repository, issue and release links point to this fork. The user guide still links to the original documentation.

Notes for the original releases are on the [Spatial Context releases page](https://github.com/Greminn/ha-spatial-context/releases).

## 1.0.0

The first stable release.

### Added
- A full documentation site, with a first floor plan walkthrough and a page for each feature.
- A key for the Connectivity Map that explains solid, dashed and grey lines, shows the weakest and strongest readings on screen, and reads off the value as you move along the bar.
- Zigbee layer support for ZHA, as well as Zigbee2MQTT.
- A Thread border router setting for the Matter layer.
- A placed and not-placed filter in the device list, with buttons to find a placed device on the plan or remove it.
- A **Use area name** button on a room, a **Getting started guide** link in the menu, and menus that close when you click away.
- A copy of the layout is kept for each version, and a version that is older than the one that saved the layout refuses to load it.

### Changed
- The panel and every command are for administrators only.
- Errors shown in the panel are short messages, and the detail goes to the Home Assistant log.
- Saves have size limits, and the debug log masks web and IP addresses.
- Zigbee readings of 0 or 1, which are stale entries in a neighbour table, are ignored. A link with no real reading is drawn grey.
- New buildings on the Property tab are placed at their real-world size.
- The panel code is split into smaller modules, and tests now run in CI.

### Fixed
- The device registry is read the way Home Assistant now expects.

## Before 1.0.0

Releases up to 0.16.0-beta.2 were pre-releases. They built the floor plan editor, the Property tab, the Connectivity Map layers (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, Matter and Bluetooth), the map data and the `get_map` action, English and German translations, and the native Home Assistant look. See the [releases page](https://github.com/Greminn/ha-spatial-context/releases) for each one.
